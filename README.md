# Conversational-Chatbot-using-GPT-2

The project focuses on creating a conversational chatbot using the GPT-2 language model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model capable of generating human-like text. The objective is to develop a chatbot that can engage users in natural language dialogues, providing contextually relevant responses across various topics.

The project utilizes Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library for implementation. The core of the chatbot is a Chatbot class, which initializes the GPT-2 model and tokenizer, generates responses based on user input, and manages the conversation loop.

The chatbot prompts users for input, generates responses using the GPT-2 model, and continues the conversation until the user decides to exit. The implementation showcases the potential of transformer-based models in creating conversational AI systems that simulate human-like interactions.
